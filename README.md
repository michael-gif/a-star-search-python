# a-star-search-python
Implementation of A* search algorithm in Python

# Usage
- look at the maze list in the code.
- a 0 represents a traversable node
- a 1 represents the starting node
- a 2 represents the ending node
- a 3 represents a non-traversable node
- give the `search` function a start and end coordinate in the form of a list or tuple, and you will get a path from the start to the end node
